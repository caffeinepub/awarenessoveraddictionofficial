Keep all authentication hooks (useInternetIdentity, useIsCallerAdmin) and state management intact. Preserve the conditional admin link logic that depends on isAuthenticated and isAdmin states. The authentication system will continue functioning in the background through the existing hooks, allowing admin users to access admin routes while the login UI remains hidden from all users."
