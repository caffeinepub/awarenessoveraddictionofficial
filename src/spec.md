# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace the Contact page with an India-specific support contact section showing only email and Instagram.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the existing Contact page content, including the full contact form (Name, Email, Subject, Message) and submit button.
- Add a single section titled "India Support Contact" displaying:
  - Email: awarenessoveraddictionoffial@gmail.com as a clickable `mailto:` link
  - Instagram: awarenessoveraddictionofficial linking to https://instagram.com/awarenessoveraddictionofficial (opens in a new tab)
- Ensure no phone number appears anywhere on the Contact page and all user-facing text remains in English.

**User-visible outcome:** Visiting `/contact` shows an "India Support Contact" section with a clickable email link and an Instagram link, with no contact form and no phone number displayed.
