  "summary": "The diff fully implements REQ-1. The SiteHeader.tsx file shows the LoginButton component has been removed from the UI (no import or render of LoginButton found), while authentication hooks (useInternetIdentity, useIsCallerAdmin) remain active in the background. The Admin link is conditionally rendered based on authentication state, confirming admin functionality is preserved. No missing requirements or hallucinated features detected.",
